# Session Persistence Fix for Android App

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **User Session Not Persisting on App Background/Close**
   - **Problem**: When the Android app was sent to background or closed, the user (professor) was automatically logged out
   - **Root Cause**: The `AuthPage` was using `authStateChanges()` stream which triggers on app lifecycle changes
   - **Solution**: 
     - Created a proper `SessionService` using `shared_preferences` to persist login state
     - Modified `AuthPage` to check session validity on app launch instead of listening to auth state changes
     - Added `WidgetsBindingObserver` to track app lifecycle and update activity timestamps

### 2. **Logout Screen Appearing Incorrectly After Login**
   - **Problem**: After professor login, sometimes the "GoodBye" logout screen appeared instead of the home screen
   - **Root Cause**: The `logout_page.dart` `HomePage` widget was incorrectly used in the authentication flow
   - **Solution**: 
     - Updated `AuthPage` to directly show `MyHomePage` (professor home screen) instead of `HomePage` from logout_page.dart
     - Removed the confusion between logout screen and home screen

## Files Modified

### 1. **lib/services/session_service.dart** (NEW FILE)
   - Created a comprehensive session management service
   - Stores: login status, email, role, and last activity timestamp
   - Methods:
     - `saveSession()` - Save user session on login
     - `isSessionValid()` - Check if session is still valid
     - `clearSession()` - Clear session on logout
     - `updateActivity()` - Update last activity timestamp
     - `getUserEmail()` and `getUserRole()` - Retrieve session data

### 2. **lib/auth/auth_page.dart**
   - Changed from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget`
   - Added `WidgetsBindingObserver` to monitor app lifecycle
   - Removed `StreamBuilder` with `authStateChanges()`
   - Added `_checkSession()` method to validate session on app start
   - Shows loading indicator while checking session
   - Directly navigates to `MyHomePage` (professor home) for authenticated users

### 3. **lib/auth/login_page.dart**
   - Added `SessionService` instance
   - Updated professor login flow to save session after successful authentication
   - Calls `_sessionService.saveSession()` with email and role='professor'

### 4. **lib/screens/Professor/settings_screen.dart**
   - Updated logout functionality to clear session
   - Added `SessionService` to clear saved session data
   - Ensures Firebase Auth sign out is also called
   - Properly cleans up all session data before navigating to login

### 5. **lib/main.dart**
   - Added `setPersistence(Persistence.LOCAL)` for Firebase Auth
   - Ensures Firebase Auth persists user session locally on Android
   - Made `AuthPage()` const for better performance

## How It Works

1. **On App Launch**:
   - `AuthPage` checks `SessionService.isSessionValid()`
   - Verifies both SharedPreferences session data and Firebase Auth state
   - Shows professor home screen if valid, otherwise shows login page

2. **On Successful Login**:
   - Firebase Auth signs in the user
   - `SessionService` saves session data locally
   - User is redirected to success animation then home screen

3. **On App Background/Resume**:
   - App lifecycle observer updates activity timestamp
   - Session remains valid as long as Firebase Auth token is valid
   - No automatic logout when app is backgrounded

4. **On Manual Logout**:
   - Session data is cleared from SharedPreferences
   - Firebase Auth signs out the user
   - User is redirected to login page

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Session Persistence**:
   - Login as professor
   - Send app to background (home button)
   - Reopen app - should remain logged in
   - Close app completely
   - Reopen app - should remain logged in

2. **Test Logout**:
   - Login as professor
   - Navigate to Settings
   - Click Logout
   - Confirm logout
   - Should see login page
   - Reopen app - should see login page (not logged in)

3. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Login as professor
   - Verify success animation shows
   - Verify professor home screen loads (not logout screen)
   - Verify all course data loads properly

## Dependencies

- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` (already in pubspec.yaml)
- `firebase_auth` (already in use)

## Android-Specific Configuration

Firebase Auth persistence is set to `Persistence.LOCAL` in main.dart, which ensures:
- User sessions persist across app restarts
- Auth tokens are stored securely on device
- No need to re-authenticate on every app launch

## Notes

- Student login flow remains unchanged (no session persistence for students by design)
- Session validation happens only once on app launch (not on every navigation)
- Firebase Auth token expiration is handled automatically by Firebase SDK
- If Firebase token expires, session is invalidated and user must re-login
