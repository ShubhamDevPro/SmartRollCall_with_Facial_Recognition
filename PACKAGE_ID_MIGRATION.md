# Package ID Migration Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully changed all package references from:
- **Old:** `com.example.smart_roll_call_flutter`
- **New:** `com.kbyai.facerecognition_flutter`

This matches the FaceRecognition standalone app's package ID, which should resolve the FaceSDK license issue.

## Files Changed

### 1. ✅ `android/app/build.gradle`
- Updated `namespace` from `com.example.smart_roll_call_flutter` to `com.kbyai.facerecognition_flutter`
- Updated `applicationId` from `com.example.smart_roll_call_flutter` to `com.kbyai.facerecognition_flutter`

### 2. ✅ `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/kbyai/facerecognition_flutter/MainActivity.kt`
- Created new MainActivity.kt with updated package declaration
- Old file location: `com/example/smart_roll_call_flutter/MainActivity.kt`
- New file location: `com/kbyai/facerecognition_flutter/MainActivity.kt`

### 3. ✅ `android/app/google-services.json`
- Updated `package_name` from `com.example.smart_roll_call_flutter` to `com.kbyai.facerecognition_flutter`
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You may need to update this in Firebase Console as well

### 4. ✅ Flutter Clean & Pub Get
- Ran `flutter clean` to remove old build artifacts
- Ran `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies

## ⚠️ Important Next Steps

### 1. Update Firebase Console (Required for Firebase features)

Since we changed the package name, you need to update your Firebase project:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **smart-roll-call-76a46**
3. Go to Project Settings → Your apps
4. Add a new Android app with package name: `com.kbyai.facerecognition_flutter`
   - Or update the existing app's package name
5. Download the new `google-services.json` file
6. Replace the current `google-services.json` with the new one

**Alternative:** If you don't want to change Firebase settings, create a new Firebase app entry for the new package name and update your `google-services.json`.

### 2. Update Firestore Security Rules

Your Firestore security rules may reference the old package name. Check and update if necessary.

### 3. Rebuild and Test

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd c:\Users\karan\SmartRollCall_with_Facial_Recognition-1

# Build the app
flutter build apk --debug

# Or run directly
flutter run
```

### 4. Verify FaceSDK License

Check the logs when the app initializes to see if the FaceSDK license now works:

```
✅ Expected: "FaceSDK initialized successfully"
❌ Previous: "FaceSDK initialization failed with code: -2"
```

### 5. Clean Old Directory (Optional)

After confirming everything works, you can remove the old MainActivity directory:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "c:\Users\karan\SmartRollCall_with_Facial_Recognition-1\android\app\src\main\kotlin\com\example" -Recurse -Force
```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] Firebase console updated with new package name
- [ ] New `google-services.json` downloaded and replaced
- [ ] App builds successfully
- [ ] FaceSDK initializes without error code -2
- [ ] Firebase authentication still works
- [ ] Firestore read/write operations work
- [ ] Face enrollment functionality works
- [ ] Face verification functionality works

## 📝 Files NOT Changed (Intentionally)

The following files reference package names but don't need to be changed for Android builds:

- `pubspec.yaml` - Flutter package name (internal, not Android package)
- `test/widget_test.dart` - Test imports use Flutter package name
- `test/esp32_integration_test.dart` - Test imports use Flutter package name
- `web/manifest.json` - Web app settings (separate from Android)
- `windows/` and `linux/` - Desktop platforms (separate from Android)

## 🚨 Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Firebase Authentication May Fail

**Symptom:** Authentication doesn't work after package change

**Solution:** Update SHA-1/SHA-256 fingerprints in Firebase Console:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew signingReport
```
Copy the SHA-1 and SHA-256 keys to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your apps → Add fingerprint

### Issue 2: Deep Links May Break

**Symptom:** Deep links or dynamic links don't work

**Solution:** Update deep link configurations in Firebase Console and AndroidManifest.xml if you're using them.

### Issue 3: Existing User Data

**Symptom:** Reinstalling the app causes data loss

**Note:** Changing package ID creates a "new app" from Android's perspective. Users would need to reinstall, and local data will be lost. Cloud data (Firebase) remains intact.

## ✅ Success Indicators

When you run the app, you should see:

```
I/flutter: 🔍 Initializing FaceSDK...
I/flutter: 📦 Package Name: com.kbyai.facerecognition_flutter
I/flutter: 🔑 Activating license...
I/flutter: 🎯 Activation result: 0
I/flutter: ✅ License activated successfully
I/flutter: 🚀 Initializing SDK...
I/flutter: ✅ FaceSDK initialized successfully
```

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

If FaceSDK still shows error code -2 after these changes:

1. **Verify package name matches:** Run `flutter run` and check the logs for the actual package name being used
2. **Check license string:** Ensure the license in `lib/services/face_enrollment_service.dart` matches the one from the working FaceRecognition app
3. **Contact KBY-AI:** They may need to issue a new license specifically for `com.kbyai.facerecognition_flutter`
