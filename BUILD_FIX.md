# Build Issue Fix - FaceSDK Integration

## Problem
When trying to build the app, you encountered this error:
```
Project with path ':libfotoapparat' could not be found in project ':facesdk_plugin'.
```

## Root Cause
The FaceSDK plugin (`facesdk_plugin`) depends on two native Android library modules:
- `:libfacesdk` - The face recognition SDK library
- `:libfotoapparat` - The camera library

These modules exist in `FaceRecognition/android/` but were not included in the main project's Gradle settings, so the build system couldn't find them.

## Solution Applied

### Updated File: `android/settings.gradle`

Added the library module references at the end of the file:

```groovy
// Include FaceSDK library modules
include ':libfacesdk'
project(':libfacesdk').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../FaceRecognition/android/libfacesdk')

include ':libfotoapparat'
project(':libfotoapparat').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../FaceRecognition/android/libfotoapparat')
```

This tells Gradle where to find these library modules relative to the main project.

## Build Status
✅ **Build now succeeds!**

The app compiles successfully with the FaceSDK integration. You can now:
- Run the app on your device
- Test face enrollment
- Test face verification for attendance

## Build Warnings (Can be Ignored)

You may see warnings about:
1. **Obsolete source/target value 8** - These come from dependencies and don't affect functionality
2. **llvm-strip errors** - Related to NDK processing of AAR files, doesn't prevent the app from working

These warnings are cosmetic and don't affect the app's functionality.

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### 2. Grant Permissions
When the app first opens, grant camera permissions when prompted.

### 3. Test Face Enrollment
1. Login as a student
2. Look for the orange "Enroll Face" card
3. Click "Enroll Face Now"
4. Capture your face photo
5. Wait for enrollment to complete

### 4. Test Face Verification
1. Create a pending verification in Firestore (or use ESP32)
2. Student receives verification prompt
3. Click "Verify & Mark Attendance"
4. Camera opens automatically
5. Face the camera for verification

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails

1. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```

2. **Check file paths:**
   Ensure these directories exist:
   - `FaceRecognition/android/libfacesdk/`
   - `FaceRecognition/android/libfotoapparat/`

3. **Check AAR files:**
   Ensure these files exist:
   - `FaceRecognition/android/libfacesdk/facesdk.aar`
   - `FaceRecognition/android/libfotoapparat/fotoapparat-2.7.0.aar`

### If Runtime Errors Occur

1. **Camera Permission Error:**
   - Grant camera permission in device settings
   - Ensure `AndroidManifest.xml` has camera permissions

2. **Face Detection Fails:**
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Face the camera directly
   - Remove glasses if possible

3. **Verification Fails:**
   - Ensure face is enrolled first
   - Use front camera for verification
   - Ensure similar lighting as enrollment
